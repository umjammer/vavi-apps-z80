/**
 * Represents a Z80 processor class that can be used to develop processor simulators or computer emulators.
 *
 * <remarks>
 * <para>
 * The Z80 processor class is intended to be used in synchronous mode and controlled by events.
 * You simply configure the instance, subscribe to the {@link #memoryAccess},
 * {@link #beforeInstructionExecution()} and {@link #afterInstructionExecution} events
 * and invoke the {@link #start(Object)} method.
 * The method returns when the processor stops execution for whatever reason (see {@link #getStopReason()}).
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The {@link #memoryAccess()},
 * {@link #beforeInstructionExecution} and {@link #afterInstructionExecution()} events
 * provide full control of the memory and ports access and the instructions executions. During these events
 * you can examine and alter the memory contents and even stop the processor execution.
 * Extra control on the memory and registers can be achieved by using custom implementations of
 * {@link Memory} and {@link Z80Registers}. The instruction execution engine itself can be
 * replaced as well by a custom implementation, see the {@link #getInstructionExecutor()} property.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * An alternative way of using the class is to use the {@link #executeNextInstruction} method.
 * This method will simply execute the next instruction (as pointed by the PC register, see {@link #getRegisters()})
 * and then returns immediately. This can be useful to allow for step-by-step debugging of Z80 code.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The default configuration when the class is instantiated is:
 * <list type="bullet">
 * <item><description>{@link #getClockFrequencyInMHz()} = 4</description></item>
 * <item><description>{@link #getClockSpeedFactor()} = 1</description></item>
 * <item><description>{@link #getAutoStopOnDiPlusHalt()} = true</description></item>
